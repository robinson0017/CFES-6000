# CFES-6000
This is a repo for all the big brains that work with dmss. Just drop anything cool in here like scripts and guides for optimizing the kits. Main goal is to rebuild support for the dead custom nsm image we use. 

# Current Stuff 
- Working on building super cool kickstart images that do stuff for you.
